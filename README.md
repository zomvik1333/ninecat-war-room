## Files

* api holds the small Vercel helpers that connect to Yahoo Fantasy. Your Yahoo sign in is kept only in an encrypted cookie in your browser.

* index.html is the full website that runs on Vercel. It also works if you just open it in a browser.
* draft-room.html is the same board in the format used for the Claude artifact.

## Version 3 (branch main), Oct 2 2026

* Opens on the real Ball Lovers draft. All 150 picks from the Yahoo draft results are on the right team, with team names, and the Oct 1 swap of LaMelo Ball and Walker Kessler is applied
* Load league draft brings that board back at any time. Reset draft gives a clean board for a mock
* The five drafted players who were missing are on the board now (Collin Gillespie, Paul Reed, Quentin Grimes, Wendell Carter Jr. and Ben Simmons)
* A player who is not on the board can be added by typing his first and last name and pressing Enter, so a pick is never skipped
* Every pick keeps its own pick number. Undo on any row takes out only that pick, and the next player you mark fills the open spot
* Marking a pick never changes your draft slot
* Search ignores accents, dots, apostrophes and dashes
* The board stops at 150 picks
* The Yahoo button tells the truth when Yahoo refuses the sync
* Josh Lloyd rankings rebuilt from the 20 show transcripts for 2026 to 27. 168 players have a Josh spot. His top 25 is his own list and the rest are read from his tier shows, the numbers he states and his category mock picks
* Each player sits 70 percent of the way from the stats spot to Josh's spot. A spot that rests on one passing remark counts 40 percent
* Positions for drafted players match what Yahoo shows for this league
* Saved boards are stored under a new key, so the board from draft night is left alone in the browser

## How to fall back to version 2

* The v7 branch holds the site exactly as it was before version 3.

## Version 2 (branch v7)

* Every pick is credited to the team whose turn it was, so all 10 rosters build themselves
* Teams tab with each roster, open starting spots and cat strengths
* Before your turn panel with what each team ahead of you needs and who they will likely take
* Survive numbers and plan projections now account for what the teams ahead of you need
* Optional Yahoo sync on the Vercel site that marks every pick from the Yahoo draft room by itself

### Yahoo setup, one time

1. Create an app at developer.yahoo.com/apps/create with redirect URI https://ninecatwarroom.vercel.app/api/callback and Fantasy Sports Read permission.
2. In Vercel, Project ninecatwarroom, Settings, Environment Variables, add YAHOO_CLIENT_ID and YAHOO_CLIENT_SECRET, then redeploy.
3. Open the site and tap Connect Yahoo.

## Version 1 (branch v1)

* Stats from the 2025 26 season, injury news as of Sept 29, 2026
* Rankings leaned toward Josh Lloyd's 9 cat top 25 and round by round comments
* Playoff schedule flags for weeks 19 to 21, punt guard, late round upside mode
* Compact board that fits without sideways scrolling

## How to fall back to version 1

1. On GitHub, switch to the v1 branch and download index.html. The v1 branch is never changed, so it always holds this version.
2. Put it in the Vercel project folder and run `vercel deploy --prod`.
3. Or, in the Vercel dashboard, open Deployments, find the deployment from Sept 29, 2026 and use Instant Rollback.
