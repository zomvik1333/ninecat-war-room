## Files

* api holds the small Vercel helpers that connect to Yahoo Fantasy. Your Yahoo sign in is kept only in an encrypted cookie in your browser.

* index.html is the full website that runs on Vercel. It also works if you just open it in a browser.
* draft-room.html is the same board in the format used for the Claude artifact.

## Version 2 (branch main)

* Every pick is credited to the team whose turn it was, so all 10 rosters build themselves
* Teams tab with each roster, open starting spots and cat strengths
* Before your turn panel with what each team ahead of you needs and who they will likely take
* Survive numbers and plan projections now account for what the teams ahead of you need
* Optional Yahoo sync on the Vercel site that marks every pick from the Yahoo draft room by itself

### Yahoo setup, one time

1. Create an app at developer.yahoo.com/apps/create with redirect URI https://ninecatwarroom.vercel.app/api/callback and Fantasy Sports Read permission.
2. In Vercel, Project ninecatwarroom, Settings, Environment Variables, add YAHOO_CLIENT_ID and YAHOO_CLIENT_SECRET, then redeploy.
3. Open the site and tap Connect Yahoo.

## Version 1 (branch v1)

* Stats from the 2025 26 season, injury news as of Sept 29, 2026
* Rankings leaned toward Josh Lloyd's 9 cat top 25 and round by round comments
* Playoff schedule flags for weeks 19 to 21, punt guard, late round upside mode
* Compact board that fits without sideways scrolling

## How to fall back to version 1

1. On GitHub, switch to the v1 branch and download index.html. The v1 branch is never changed, so it always holds this version.
2. Put it in the Vercel project folder and run `vercel deploy --prod`.
3. Or, in the Vercel dashboard, open Deployments, find the deployment from Sept 29, 2026 and use Instant Rollback.
